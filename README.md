The goal of CelestiaKala is to provide Vedic astrology calculations for R users interested in Hindu astrology and Muhurta calculations.

Note: While other packages such as *VedicDateTime* on CRAN provide Vedic calendar details (e.g. Tithi, Nakshatra), *CelestiaKala* is specifically focused on calculating Rahu Kalam on periods based on sunrise and sunset times. The implementation is original and was inspired by cultural use cases.
